# Elfa's Kotlin Extension Functions Library

Elfa's Kotlin Extension Functions Library is a collection of useful extension functions designed to simplify common tasks in Kotlin programming. Named in memory of my grandmother Elfa, who had a passion for technology but passed away in 1997 before the internet era, this library is a tribute to her memory.

## Functions Available

- [countDivisorsByK](IntRange.kt): Counts the number of integers divisible by a given number within a range.
- [alphabetIndex](Char.kt): Returns the index of the alphabet for a given character.

More functions will be added in the future.
